Just so I keep track of what I am doing, didn't find something on archlinux, so i just 
made mine. I mean it's not something complicated.

Still need to customize the time for work. Maybe different sessions.

Also specify a ratio for the break.

## Build

'''sh
mkdir build; cd build; 
cmake ..
make 
'''

## Run
'''sh
./Podomore
'''
